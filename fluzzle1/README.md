# This is FLUZZLE
My entry to the Flutter Puzzle Hack competition.

## Getting Started
The name is a combination of "FLUTTER" and "PUZZLE". Genius right - lol!

Fluzzle is a sliding tile game that uses images for the puzzle instead of just numbers. You can choose from 8 pretty images for your gaming enjoyment.

The normal sliding tile game is a bit boring, so I added a twist.
In 'slide' mode, Fluzzle plays just like a normal sliding tile game, but in 'flip' mode the tiles can also flip horizontally or vertically or both.
This can make it really hard to solve.
But, you can also turn ON or OFF the position numbers on the tiles for easy or difficult Fluzzle fun.

For extra Fluzzle pleasure you can also select the number of tiles from 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5.

There is also a 'Shuffle' button to randomise the game grid if you get stuck - but don't click there waiting for a fortunate tile layout - the maximum number of correct tiles upon 'Shuffle' is 3. Haha!
